# Teleworking and the gender pay gap
In this project, I estimate the causal effect of teleworking on the gender pay gap. First, I find that women are more likely to telework than men. Second, using an instrumental variable based on a teleworkability measure at the occupational level, I find no significant effect of teleworking on wages. Therefore, I find no evidence that teleworking contributes to the gender pay gap.
